                            Chocolate is a food made from cacao beans. ... 
                            It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form
                            like hot chocolate. Commercial chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added.
                            Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to
                            make drinking chocolate.

                            Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough
                            topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or
                            other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting,
                            using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.
